/*
 * Hello challenger! Welcome to the Fibonacci Forest.
 *
 * Kata: 
 * 
 * Your quest is to rediscover the Fibonacci sequence, which will unlock the secrets of the enchanted Fibonacci Forest. 
 * You need to implement a function that returns the nth Fibonacci number efficiently. It should throw an error for negative numbers.
 * 
 * The sequence follows the rule that each number is equal to the sum of the preceding two numbers. 
 * The Fibonacci sequence begins with the following 14 integers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233 ... 
 *
 * 
 * A few examples:
 *    `fibonacci(0)` should return 0 as the 0th Fibonacci number is 0
 *    `fibonacci(1)` should return 1 as the 1st Fibonacci number is 1
 *    `fibonacci(10)` should return 55 as the 10th Fibonacci number is 55
 *    `fibonacci(50)` should return 12586269025 as the 50th Fibonacci number is 12586269025
